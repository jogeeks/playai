AI Serendipity Generator Machine - Full Project Prompt
Project Overview
Build a 3D immersive web experience called "AI Serendipity Generator Machine" inspired by Burning Man's desert aesthetic. Users explore a mystical desert environment and interact with an AI-powered oracle machine that generates personalized "serendipity missions" based on their aspirations.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite
3D Graphics: React Three Fiber (@react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei)
State Management: Zustand with subscribeWithSelector middleware
Animations: Framer Motion
Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom gradients
UI Components: Radix UI primitives (Button, Card, Textarea)
Icons: Lucide React
Core Features
1. Desert 3D Environment
Procedurally generated terrain with rolling sand dunes using sine wave displacement
Gradient sky dome (orange sunset to deep blue with stars)
Distant silhouettes representing art installations
Ground fog effect with additive blending
Atmospheric fog (distance-based)
2. AI Serendipity Machine
Futuristic cylindrical design with:
Metallic body with glow rings (cyan/blue)
Animated LED strips
Holographic display panels with scan lines
Particle emitters around the base
Central glowing core sphere
Top dome with transparency
Floating animation (sine wave hover)
Processing state animation (faster rotation, scale pulsing)
Changes color when processing (blue → orange)
3. User Interaction Flow
User "approaches" the machine (currently simulated - isNearMachine state)
Input modal appears with glowing cyberpunk styling
User enters aspiration (max 150 characters)
Processing animation with progress steps:
"Analyzing input..."
"Extracting keywords..."
"Consulting wisdom database..."
"Weaving possibilities..."
"Calibrating serendipity..."
"Mission generated!"
Animated mission parchment appears with:
Mission type icon and color theme
Personalized title and description
Letter-by-letter reveal animation
Download option (saves as .txt file)
Generate new mission option
4. Mission Types (5 categories)
Connection (pink/purple): Social/relationship missions
Creativity (orange/red): Artistic expression missions
Adventure (green/teal): Exploration missions
Learning (blue/indigo): Knowledge-seeking missions
Self-Discovery (purple/pink): Introspection missions
5. UI/HUD Elements
Top-left: Game title with backdrop blur
Top-right: Audio toggle (M key), Help toggle
Bottom-center: Context-aware instructions
Help overlay: Full tutorial with controls and mission explanations
Keyboard shortcuts: M (mute), F (fullscreen)
